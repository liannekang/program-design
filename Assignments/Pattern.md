## Pattern

For this assignment you will program a pattern generator in DrawBot that builds on our initial explorations in DrawBot. Your pattern generator should challenge your programming skills, whatever level they may be at. 

## Questions

* How do you define what a pattern is? How expansive could this definition be?
* Is having an end product for the pattern in mind helpful  or limiting to you as you work?
* What is a shape in a module? Vector? Raster? Text?

## Considerations

* Color, how do you want to use it? Will it be pre-defined, user selectable, random?
* How will you layout your modules? What sorts of schemes could you use?
* How complex could your module be? Will it always be drawn in the same orientation?
* How could you work in reflection and translation in to your pattern making?
* When you hear “pattern” what are the rules you think of? What is the opposite of those rules?

## Your start

For Tuesday, January 28th, bring in 10 examples of found pattern, printed out (B&W is 100% ok). Choose one and remake it in DrawBot. The fidelity need not be high, but you need to get the placement and modules roughed in well.

## Pattern generator requirements:

1. The size of the repeat for your pattern can be specified by the user
2. The size of the final pattern can be specified by the user

Beyond the basic requirements, the requirements are set by you, the designer. We will be using these patterns in the book studio to explore different printing methods, so the ability for your pattern to be one or two colors will be handy, but not required for the final.
